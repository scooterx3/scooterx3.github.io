I"µ<p>So I have been trying to figure this out. I am supposed to be able to do some port forwarding, which isnâ€™t hard, but it wasnâ€™t working. Eventually I went with the option of setting up two network adapters, one set up on NAT (so the VM can access the www) and another as a host-only, so the host can access the guest on 192.168.x.x</p>

<p>I was having a problem though, it was refusing me. I turned off the VM and turned off the NAT adapter. Then I was able to connect via SSH using 192.168.x.x and then enabled the NAT adapter after having logged in via SSH and it worked.</p>

<p>Chances are I was probably doing something really retarded (still might be), but at least Iâ€™m in.</p>
