I"ò<p>I just learned that Pidgin can do serverless, no-configuration LAN instant messaging by using a Bonjour â€œaccountâ€. All you need to do is add an account as normal, select â€œBonjourâ€ from the dropdown and add a username. I also had to punch a hole in the firewall of the computers I was using (tcp, check account â€œadvancedâ€ settings tab for port number). Specifically, when one person wanted to initiate a conversation with another, that other personâ€™s firewall needed to be open.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is great. I never knew about Bonjour, Iâ€™d been trying to get some simple IM thing going for my wife and myself at home but all of the other options I could find werenâ€™t really to my liking. Pidgin is a solid client in my opinion.</p>
