I"­<p>Iâ€™ve got a Dell N411Z laptop. Nothing flashy, and it got dropped on one corner so when I adjust the tilt of the screen, the broken hinge triggers a button, which randomly sends a signal for the letter â€˜xâ€™ to whatever app is active at the time. Here are my notes to get it to quit doing that.</p>

<p>install â€˜xbindkeysâ€™ (available in main repositories for both Ubuntu and Fedora). You have to find out what the â€œsignalâ€ looks like to xbindkeys, do so by running <span style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">xbindkeys -k.</span></span> It tells you then to push a key. Just push the key at the top (the left two are the same signal, the right is a different one as I recall but it doesnâ€™t work anymore). I got this out of it:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"(Scheme function)"
 m:0x40 + c:133
 Mod4 + Super_L
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So then I paste that into ~/.xbindkeysrc, replacing the â€œ(Scheme function)â€ part with just â€œâ€. Then to make it take effect, just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xbindkeys -p</code>Â and youâ€™re golden.</p>
