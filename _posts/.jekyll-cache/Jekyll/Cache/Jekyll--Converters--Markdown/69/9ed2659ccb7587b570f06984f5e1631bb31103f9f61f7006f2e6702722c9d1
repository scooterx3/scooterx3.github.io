I"¸<p>Just wanted to write one or two of these, maybe more as time goes on:</p>

<p>egrep:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>egrep -o "(['\"])root\1"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This one I wanted to get either a â€˜ or a â€ before the word â€œrootâ€ and then find the closing one, whichever it was. The key here is that with egrep you have to surround the statement in quotes, the opening/closing parentheses donâ€™t need escaping, and use a backslash followed by a number to denote the group</p>

<p>Â </p>

<p>sed:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sed 's|\(['\''\"]\)root\1|great|g' sometest.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This one actually shows two interesting things about sed. One is quotes. Notice I had to close the first quotation, then escape a single quote, then reopen quotation. Sed is wacky.</p>

<p>But the point of this one is that I can use capture groups. reference by using \1. The opening/closing parentheses need to be escaped. The captured group can be referenced either in the part being replaced or the part doing the replacing.</p>
