I"µ<p>Had to write this down. Iâ€™ve been trying to get up and going with KVM recently. I got a break from school and need KVM up on my home server so I can experiment with many other things. I read through a bunch of the libvirt documentation, specifically about virt-install, and then once I had a grasp I ran through some tutorials. Most of the tutorials I found out there and virt-install one-liners had me using a network option as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>--network bridge=virbr0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I eventually learned that that was Â not what I wanted to use for a server VM. But the thing is, I was trying to re-follow a guide where I needed to create a bridge network device on the host and link my primary ethernet one to it, so that the VMs could reside on the same network as the host. I anticipated making some changes that I admittedly didnâ€™t understand,Â and thought I might break the network connection. In preparation I created a user/pass for my brother, whose house is where the server resides. That was wise, because sure enough, I broke it. But the odd part is that no sooner did I break it than the thought finally blazed into my brain that Iâ€™d been using the wrong bridge the entire time! I had physically created this new bridge â€˜br0â€™ but constantly had been creating VMs and having them use this â€˜virbr0â€™ one instead. Croike. It took me a few days to actually be able to sit down with my brother over the phone so I could get him to copy my backed-up network script back into place and get me going. I just got that done and finally now Iâ€™m up and going since Iâ€™m using the proper network device as my bridge.</p>

<p>Life is funny. Iâ€™ll be using this for my VMs from now on:</p>
