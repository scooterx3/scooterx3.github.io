I"Ÿ<p>When uploading to Google Docs, the PDF doesnâ€™t make it through without getting beat up. My page numbers are missing, the table of contents isÂ gone, etc. I heard that if one converts the PDF to ePub, the data is preserved. I know of a program called Calibre that allows one to convert PDF to ePub. <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/169618/is-there-a-way-to-convert-a-pdf-file-to-epub-format-without-using-calibre">This post suggested some commands</a>:</p>

<p>Â </p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ebook-convert file.pdf file.epub
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the output looks a little wrong â€“ try this</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ebook-convert file.pdf file.epub --enable-heuristics
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It will try a â€œsmartâ€ way to convert. Not perfect, but can work well in most conversions.</p>

<p>So I tried this, and it honestly didnâ€™t work out so well. Sure, I had an epub formatted book but it didnâ€™t at all match the layout of the original document and appeared all jumbled.</p>
