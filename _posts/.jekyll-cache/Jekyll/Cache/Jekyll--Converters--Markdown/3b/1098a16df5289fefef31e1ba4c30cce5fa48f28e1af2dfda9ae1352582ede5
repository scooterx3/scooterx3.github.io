I"‘<p>I just found out that in some systems (looking at centOS 7 currently) have a â€˜wheelâ€™ group, which supposedly is the equivalent of the â€˜sudoâ€™ group on my Ubuntu install. Wheel is something old-school that stuck around. Meant â€œbig wheelâ€ which apparently wasÂ something like â€œbig cheeseâ€, which also doesnâ€™t make sense but they mean â€œsomeone with powerâ€ or â€œin chargeâ€.</p>
