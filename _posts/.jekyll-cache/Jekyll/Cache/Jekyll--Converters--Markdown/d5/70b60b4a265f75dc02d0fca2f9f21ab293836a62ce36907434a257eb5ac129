I"—<p>I was recently asked how to show threads instead of PIDs using the â€˜psâ€™ command. I wanted to find out why thatâ€™s even desiredÂ in the first place. I donâ€™t have experience dealing with such things. I did learn new things, but still donâ€™t really know why one would care about listing the threads. Can one manipulate them? Wouldnâ€™t it cause erratic behavior? Is the killing of individual threads of a process allowed from outside? Or would it kill the whole process? I donâ€™t know!</p>

<h2 id="threads-are-little-pieces-insideof-processes">Threads are little pieces insideÂ of processes</h2>

<p>I think of processes to the overall computer as I do threads to the process.Â There are some differences. Hereâ€™s a little bit of an outline:</p>

<h3 id="processes">Processes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Do not share address space</li>
  <li>Execute independently of one another. Synchronization is handled by the kernel.</li>
  <li>Context switching between processes is slow</li>
  <li>interaction between processes handled via IPC â€“ inter-process communication</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="threads">Threads</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Do share address space (within the same process)</li>
  <li>Thread synchronization is handled by the parent process</li>
  <li>Context switching between threads is fast</li>
  <li>Threads under the same process share memory, text, etc so can easily interact</li>
  <li>threads donâ€™t know which thread created them</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Threads in the same process share:
    <ul>
      <li>Process instructions</li>
      <li>Most data</li>
      <li>open files (descriptors)</li>
      <li>signals and signal handlers</li>
      <li>current working directory</li>
      <li>User and group id</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Each thread has a unique:
    <ul>
      <li>Thread ID</li>
      <li>set of registers, stack pointer</li>
      <li>stack for local variables, return addresses</li>
      <li>signal mask</li>
      <li>priority</li>
      <li>Return value: <tt>errno</tt></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, so that was honestly just kindof a dump of info. What Iâ€™ve learned though is that there are ways to display the threads that pertain to a particular process. The first time I saw it and realized what it was, I was using htop and noticed my starbound_server process had what I thought were several instances of the same process running under it:</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://69.89.26.186/screenshots/20160923-185356-8607.png" width="759" height="173" />What I didnâ€™t realize was that those green lines are the THREADS Â under pid2499. What I donâ€™t understand yet is why they appear to have their own PIDs. Because in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ps H 2499</code> I get:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[riley@whitey ~]$ ps H 2499 
 PID TTY STAT TIME COMMAND
 2499 pts/1 Sl+ 0:00 ./starbound_server
 2499 pts/1 Sl+ 0:00 ./starbound_server
 2499 pts/1 Sl+ 0:00 ./starbound_server
 2499 pts/1 Sl+ 0:00 ./starbound_server
 2499 pts/1 Sl+ 0:00 ./starbound_server
 2499 pts/1 Sl+ 0:00 ./starbound_server
 2499 pts/1 Sl+ 0:02 ./starbound_server
 2499 pts/1 Sl+ 0:00 ./starbound_server
 2499 pts/1 Sl+ 0:00 ./starbound_server
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where itâ€™s apparent that they are displaying as all using the same PID, which I assume is supposed to make it so itâ€™s obvious that theyâ€™re all threadsÂ of the same process.</p>

<p>Anyway, the original question is now answered. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ps H</code>Â is the appropriate command to show the threads of a process.</p>

<p>Something else Iâ€™ve learned is that thereâ€™s apparently a max number of processes. Itâ€™s found inÂ `/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max`, or at least on Ubuntu and CentOS.</p>
