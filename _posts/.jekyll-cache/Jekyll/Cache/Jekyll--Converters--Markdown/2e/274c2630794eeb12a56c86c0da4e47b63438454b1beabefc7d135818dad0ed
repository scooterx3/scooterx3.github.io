I"ô<p>I didnâ€™t know this but thereâ€™s this thing in Sublime Text 3 referred to as a â€œbuilderâ€ that basically lets you run some code against whatever file/project youâ€™re in.</p>

<p>The reason Iâ€™m using this is because I hate having a separate terminal open to run a script Iâ€™m working on. Instead I can just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ctrl+b</code> and itâ€™ll run the code and display the output in a window at the bottom of my Sublime window.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s what I used:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
	"cmd": ["/usr/bin/python3", "-u", "$file"], 
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I went to Tools &gt; Build System &gt; New Build System, pasted the above in and called it â€œpython3.sublime-buildâ€. It resides under ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/. Now when I hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ctrl+b</code> it runs my Python and shows me the output! Sweet!</p>
