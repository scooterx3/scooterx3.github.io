I just learned about the &#8216;SHOW CHARACTER SET&#8217; statement; it lists all of the available character sets and their default collations on a particular mySQL server. Handy if you just need to know which character sets/collations a server does or does not support.

The mySQL manual does say this though:

> In cases where a character set has multiple collations, it might not be clear which collation is most suitable for a given application.

And I&#8217;m not sure how to see if a char set does have multiple collations and what they might be.
