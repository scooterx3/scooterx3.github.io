I had heard at some point of an app that would allow one to edit .odt files in the browser, and apparently also .doc and .docx files (microsoft).Â I had to just download and unpack the app to the right location in my ownCloud instance, then install libreoffice (I prefer libre over open for some reason). One thing I didn&#8217;t know though was that I needed to install the &#8220;libreoffice-headless&#8221; package so it wouldn&#8217;t try to use the x server (nonexistent) on the machine. It was trying to, but failed a bunch naturally.
