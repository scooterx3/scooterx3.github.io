Sources lists found in:

~~~
/etc/apt/sources.list
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
~~~

Apt-get and apt-cache commands go hand-in-hand, whereas aptitude is new and kinda rolls them into one.

There&#8217;s a script called:

~~~
dpkg-reconfigure
~~~

which can walk one through the initial setup of a package that they&#8217;d have found when they first installed a package.
