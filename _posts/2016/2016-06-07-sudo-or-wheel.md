I just found out that in some systems (looking at centOS 7 currently) have a &#8216;wheel&#8217; group, which supposedly is the equivalent of the &#8216;sudo&#8217; group on my Ubuntu install. Wheel is something old-school that stuck around. Meant &#8220;big wheel&#8221; which apparently wasÂ something like &#8220;big cheese&#8221;, which also doesn&#8217;t make sense but they mean &#8220;someone with power&#8221; or &#8220;in charge&#8221;.
