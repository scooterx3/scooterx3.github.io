A few new commands for manipulating text that I never knew about:

  * paste 
      * allows one to &#8220;paste&#8221; two files side by side. First row&#8217;s contents of fileB.txt will be to the left of the first row&#8217;s contents of fileA.txt, and on down the line.
  * join 
      * Imagine mysql or something, this &#8220;joins&#8221; two (or maybe more) files together on a common field in whitespace-separated lines. It ignores unique values (at least by default)
  * expand 
      * I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d ever use this for, but it will convert tabs into spaces. Makes a file fixed-width, rather than tabbed. For whatever one needs that for.
