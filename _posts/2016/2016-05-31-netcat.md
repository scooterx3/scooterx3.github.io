Just was playing around with it, wanted to write a few things down. I typically use telnet to test for a particular port. Essentially the basic usage is:

~~~
nc some.domain.com 21
~~~

That will connect to some.domain.com on port 21 if possible. What I want to use it for though is to just quickly check a series of ports. Here&#8217;s the command I like currently:

~~~
nc portquiz.net 21 -zv
~~~

the -z only checks for connection, but /dev/nulls any response from the server. The -v goes with it and just displays a message saying &#8220;hey yo, it connected!&#8221;

I know this thing handles ranges by using something like &#8216;1-10&#8217; as the port, but doesn&#8217;t seem to handle an array of individual ports, say for checking just FTP, SSH and perhaps IMAP all in the same command. I want to write a wrapper to handle that. I ran into a snag though in Bash dealing with $@ (array of arguments) which I was going to leverage so as to be able to run something like:

~~~
scan portquiz.net 21 22 143
~~~

But that&#8217;s another topic for another day.

I want to play around with it some for setting up a listening server. Just to toy around, I really don&#8217;t have anything I&#8217;d need to listen to :P.
