When VMware gets installed, it checks to make sure the proper kernel modules are installed when first run. It fails for me on Fedora24. I am not savvy when it comes to these things so I had to go digging. I found this resource:

Which worked wonderfully. Basically I had to run [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElCoyote27/krynn-tools/master/Update_VMW.sh) that the author of the article made, which as I understand altered vmware files. Then I ranÂ vmware-modconfig to go ahead and allow vmware to update kernel modules for me, which it did with no problem. Done. Woot!
