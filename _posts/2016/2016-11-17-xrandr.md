Just wanted to write down that I created a quick method for a coworker to fix her monitors when she docked her laptop. The problem was that XFCE (she&#8217;s using Xubuntu 16.04) wasn&#8217;t remembering the monitor&#8217;s settings. When she docked the laptop, she had to manually put things back using the GUI for monitor settings. I wrote a quick script something like this:

~~~
#!/bin/bash
xrandr --output &lt;monitor 1&gt; --auto
xrandr --output &lt;monitor 2&gt; --auto
xrandr --output &lt;monitor 3&gt; --auto
xrandr --output &lt;monitor 2&gt; --right-of &lt;monitor 1&gt; --output &lt;monitor 3&gt; --right-of &lt;monitor 2&gt;
~~~

The <monitor> names were different, I retrieved them from her system using `xrandr -q`. I did find that without running the &#8211;auto lines FIRST, nothing else took. xrandr man page and examples made it seem like I could do one single command and have everything work. But in this case, one single command made everything break instead.

I then just added a button to her menu that she can click. If I could hijack the signal somehow of when theÂ computer was docked I could do that, rather than have XFCE pop up a &#8220;what do you wanna do with these monitors?&#8221; dialogue. But it is what it is. She no longer dreads having to undock and go to a meeting.
