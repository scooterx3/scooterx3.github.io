DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
===

Process (DORA):

 * **D**iscover
 * **O**ffer
 * **R**equest
 * **A**CK (acknowledgement)

**Scope:** DHCP Server could be integrated into the router or be a separate beast altogether. It's assigned a **scope**, or pool of addresses in the z.a area (x.y.z.a) that it can potentially use. 

**Lease:** The amount of time that a DHCP client is allowed by the DHCP server to use the dynamically assigned IP 

**Options** (Some examples):

 * DNS server
 * Gateway IP

IP Helper / Relay
===
What happens if we want to have a DHCP server not attached to the LAN that helps with multiple networks? That's where the IP Helper/Relay comes into play. 

 * We create multiple scopes on the DHCP server for each network
 * Set up different options such as DNS servers, gateways. 
 * The Router would then be set up to ship DHCP packets to a particular DHCP server. 


Configure DHCP Server
===

 * Watched windows config

 * Watched cisco config

 * Watched wireshark pick up the DHCP DORA packets

Woo!
