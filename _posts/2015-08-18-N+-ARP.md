Learning the L2 (MAC) address that maps to a L3 (IP) address 

The problem: 

As the data (let's say it's an email) gets encapsulated at Layer 3 and turned into a packet, it then gets to Layer 2 and needs to be encapsulated as a "frame" with the source and destination MAC addresses. How does the Layer 2 device know what the destination MAC address is? _By doing an ARP request._

From what I gather, this ARP request broadcasts across the whole network, basically saying "hey yo, I'm looking for the MAC address that is associated with X IP address". All devices get that. Then the device which does actually use that local network IP address in question responds to just the original sender and says "homeslice; I've got your IP address and my MAC address is Y".

Once it's got this MAC address, that MAC address can then be used to encapsulate the email packet with the source and destination MAC addresses and sent along it's merry way.
